# OpenCPMD
OpenCPMD is a community of developers and users of the CPMD program that formed after it was made freely available under the MIT license in 2022.
Present members (in alphabetic order): Mauro Boero, Jógvan Magnus Haugaard Olsen, Takashi Ikeda, Emiliano Ippoliti, Tobias Klöffel, Davide Mandelli, Gerald Mathias.

## What is CPMD?
The CPMD code is a parallelized **plane wave / pseudopotential** implementation of Density Functional Theory, particularly designed for ab-initio molecular dynamics.

### History
The development of CPMD started in 1990 by a team of researchers at IBM Research Zurich. Between 1994 and 2001, the CPMD code was jointly developed between IBM and the Max Planck Institute. In 2001, a consortium has been established in order to coordinate the development and distribution of the CPMD code. The consortium was a virtual organization that comprised all the users and developers of the CPMD code around the world.  This organization was coordinated by [Alessandro Curioni](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=zurich-cur) (IBM) and  was founded by [Prof. Michele Parrinello](http://www.rgp.ethz.ch) (USI) and [Prof. Wanda Andreoni](http://c3pn.epfl.ch/page-77528-en.html) (EPFL).
Many members of the CPMD consortium (http://www.cpmd.org/) contributed to the code in its present form, mainly: Juerg Hutter, Mauro Boero, Alessandro Curioni, Mark Tuckerman, Ivano Tavernelli, Axel Kohlmeyer, Nisanth Nair, Ari Seitsonen, Wolfram Quester, Dominik Marx, Valery Weber, Teodoro Laino, Takashi Ikeda, Ali Alavi, Jochen Blumberger.

In 2022, IBM made the CPMD code freely available on GitHub under the MIT License.
